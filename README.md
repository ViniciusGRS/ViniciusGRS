- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ViniciusGRS, but you can call me Vini.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning how to code, so a friend told me to create a GitHub account so that it can help me learning code,
-  plus it gives me the oportunity to code any project that i might have here on the platform if the idea comes up.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, also interested in learning C.
